# Dust

Dust consists of two programs:
- `dust` -> an LLVM-based optimizing compiler for brainfuck (completed)
- `dusty` -> a JIT, LLVM-based interpreter for brainfuck (coming summer 2024 (hopefully))

Note that after `dusty` is done `dust` will simply use `dusty`'s code for lexing and parsing.

## What's Next?

See [the todo list](TODO.md) for things unfinished that will be implemented eventually

Check out [Issues](https://github.com/AntimatterReactor/Dust/issues) for problems that I noticed (also will eventually be fixed)
